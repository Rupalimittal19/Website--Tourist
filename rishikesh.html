<p align="center">
Located in the foothills of the Himalayas along the convergence of Ganga and Chandrabhaga River, Rishikesh (also called as Hrishikesh) is known for its <br>
adventure activities, ancient temples, popular cafes and as the "Yoga Capital of the World". With whitewater rafting industry growing and varied camping and <br>
cafe spots springing up, Rishikesh has grown immensely as a favourite, catering to people with different needs.</p>

<p align="center">
Over the years, the tranquil town has become extremely popular as the top spiritual destination in the world, especially after the Beatles association with <br>
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi here in the late '60s. As it lies on the holy banks of river Ganga, Rishikesh has been a hub of Sadhus (saints) with numerous ashrams <br>
teaching spirituality, yoga, meditation and Ayurveda springing up, the most popular of which is the Beatles Ashram.</p>
<p align="center">
With the influx of tourists, there has been a surge in the number of cafes and restaurants in the town. However, in the last few years, Rishikesh has also been <br>
developed as the hub of Adventure Sports in India as there is a multitude of options including White Water Rafting, Bungee Jumping, Flying Fox, and Mountain Biking <br>
among others. It also serves as the gateway to many Himalayan treks and is used as a popular camping site making it a beautiful melange of spiritual and <br>
adrenaline-pumping experiences. Rishikesh also holds the International Yoga Festival in the first week of March which sees yoga enthusiasts from all over the globe.</p>

<h4 align="center"><b><i><u>How to reach</u></i></b><br>
<u><b>By air:</u></b><br> Kerala has three main airports – Calicut International Airport, Cochin International Airport, and Trivandrum International Airport.<br>
These airports connect Kerala with different cities across the world, such as Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Muscat, and Dubai.<br>
<u><b>By rail:</u></b><br> Thiruvananthapuram Central railway station, Ernakulam Junction railway station, and Kollam Junction railway station are three major<br>
rail heads of Kerala. These stations connect the state with cities and towns across India.<br>
<br>
<b><i><u>Best time to visit</u></i></b><br>
September to February is the best time to visit Kerala when it is relatively cooler. While summers (March to May) make the state too hot for comfort<br>
and the monsoons (June - August) can receiver downpour that can heavier than imagined and is not entirely advisable to all tourists. But for some, it can<br>
be a beautiful amalgamation of festivals, scenic views and the much talked about Ayurvedic treatments. <br></h4>

<p align="center">
Shimla is often covered with nearby towns of Kufri, a hill-station almost always covered by snow and Chail, famous for a huge palace and the highest cricket <br>
ground in the world. Tourists also visit the famous Jakhu Temple and engage in sightseeing at various viewpoints during their trip to Shimla</p>

<p align="center">
Shimla is well connected with many cities and is just 4 hours from the nearby city of Chandigarh. The city has an airport as well; however, there aren't many <br>
daily flights from here. The railway station connects Shimla with the plans and is famous for the Kalka-Shimla train route; a UNESCO listed World Heritage site.</p>

<p align="center">
The weather is pleasant for most of the months with tourists flocking especially during the summer months. The winters are cold with some days of snow from <br>
mid-December till February end. Tourists flock to the centrally located Mall Road and the Ridge, a walking-only area which is lined up with multiple shops, cafes <br>
and restaurants.</p>
